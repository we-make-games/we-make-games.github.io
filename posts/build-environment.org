I have created a skeleton app that defines the most important dependencies of the final product so you can already test
if you have all dependencies available to you. 
Make sure to install make, cmake, gcc, tinyxml, SDL2, SDL2__mixer and SDL2__TTF.

The result is a tiny sdl app that you can quit by typing "quit".

This is also a good time to think about which text editor to use. 
My favorite editor is emacs (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). You can use whatever editor works for you but it
will most likely have neither tetris nor minesweper.
